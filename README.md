# General Assembly SEIR Project 2
## Description
With this project, I created an app that takes chart info from the Last.fm API and displays it in a simple, easy to read format. There are two tabs that display the most popular items of the current week; one for artists, and another for tracks. I provided links to the respective Last.fm pages of the items, as well as a numerical representation of their popularity, in the form of listener/stream count.

I knew I wanted to use a music API because music is something I am very passionate about, as well as data and numbers. I've always enjoyed looking at lists and charts that revolve around musical critique and popularity.

## Technologies Used
For this project, I used JavaScript and React.
## Getting Started/Installation Instructions
Fork the repository. Open your terminal, and then change into the directory that you want the repository to live in. Then run the following command in your terminal:

```git clone <HTTPS or SSH key>```

Change directories into the cloned repository, then run the following commands:

```npm i``` ```npm start```

Now you should see the react application running in your browser!

## Contribution Guidelines
If you wish to edit the code, or just play around with it, follow the steps above. Before opening the repository in your code editor, you should switch to a new branch so that the main one is not affected. Run the following:

```git checkout -b <your branch name>```

Now that you are on a branch that is separate from the main branch, you can begin your edits! Run ``` code .``` to begin. If and when you want to submit your edits, run the following commands:

```git add -A``` ```git commit -m "<a brief message describing what you did>"``` ```git push origin <your branch name>```

Now a pull request will appear on the repository page which can be merged with the main branch!

If you just want to identify bugs, or suggest improvements, you can submit an issue in the Issues tab above. Just choose a title and write whatever you want!
